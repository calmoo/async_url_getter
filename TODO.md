* Fill in the README
    - Mention all "decisions" e.g. default timeouts
    - Decision = test thoroughly with mocks + manual testing
    - Mention 100% test coverage + mypy type hints = how I achieved code quality
    - Chose to use click because it has testing functionality
    - Which error types are handled (and which aren't [e.g. invalid URL without 'http'?]) and why
    - Next step: custom limit
    - Next step: maybe handle more errors
    - Decision made: Round time to 3dp (explain in comment and README)
