Write a command-line tool using the asyncio library that takes a file with a URL per line as input.
The program should make GET requests to each URL, without blocking on a response.
As output, it should print (in the order the requests are returned, as soon as they are returned) the time taken for
each request and its HTTP status code.
Finally, it should output the mean, median, and 90th percentile response times.
Be sure to handle cases where some URLs are invalid or when the server doesn't respond.
